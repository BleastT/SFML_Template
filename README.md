# SFML_Template

To use thi template, you need to have installed:
  Mingw -(https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-setup.exe/download)
  
Simply download the project and then run the Setup_SFML.bat file.
You will be prompted to enter a name for your project.
Leave it for a couple of seconds and you will find your project outside yout current directory.

Once your project is ready, open the folder and run the build.bat file to debug or release.
All your programs have to be inside the src folder. If you have some experience with bat file you can also modify the build.bat file
to handle your needs.

In the .vscode folder there is a tasks file that will alow you to simply use F5 when you are in vscode to quickly test your project.

ENJOY!
